-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Wrinkle detection using Discontinuity and Curvature scans, as described
in Yinxiao Li's Thesis and in article:
 * Y. Li, X. Hu, D. Xu, Y. Yue, E. Grinspun, and P. Allen, “Multi-
Sensor Surface Analysis for Robotic Ironing,” in IEEE International
